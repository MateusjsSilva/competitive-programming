# Competitive Programming

Welcome to the Competitive Programming repository! This repository contains solutions to various competitive programming problems solved using different algorithms and data structures.

## Purpose

The main goals of this repository are:
- To store solutions for problems from competitive programming platforms like Beecrowd, Codeforces, HackerRank, LeetCode, and others.
- To provide examples of how algorithms and data structures can be applied to solve real-world competitive programming problems.
- To serve as a learning resource for anyone looking to enhance their problem-solving skills and knowledge of algorithms.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on platforms or contests. Here's how it's structured:

- Each platform or contest has its own folder.
- Each problem is stored in its own folder, named after the problem's title or ID.
- The problem folder contains:
  - The solution file(s) (e.g., `.cpp`, `.java`, `.py`, `.cs`).
  - A README or a comment within the code explaining the approach, the algorithm used, and any specific optimizations.
